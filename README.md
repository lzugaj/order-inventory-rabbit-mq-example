# Order Processing System with Inventory Update


### Reference Documentation

This project is an e-commerce order processing system that demonstrates real-world asynchronous communication between different services using a message queue. It ensures that order requests are handled efficiently, and inventory is updated in near real-time. The system uses RabbitMQ as the message broker to decouple services and enable reliable communication.
